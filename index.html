  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
  I'm a driven Electrical Engineering student at the University of Michigan with a strong focus on embedded systems, firmware development, and hardware-software integration. I enjoy building low-level systems that bridge physical devices with efficient, real-time software. My experience includes hands-on work with STM32 microcontrollers, serial communication protocols (UART, SPI, I2C), and signal processing for audio and control applications. 
  </p>
  <p>
  With internships at General Motors and multiple hardware projects under my belt, I bring a practical understanding of how to develop embedded solutions that are robust, scalable, and production-ready. Iâ€™m looking to join a team where I can contribute to innovative systems â€” from real-time control loops to low-power hardware interfacing â€” and grow into a role that challenges me to push the boundaries of what embedded technology can do.
